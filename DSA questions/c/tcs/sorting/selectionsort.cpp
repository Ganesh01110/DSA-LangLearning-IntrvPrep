// Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Selection sorting algorithm.
// Example 1:
// Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
// Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
// Explanation: After sorting the array is: 9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52

// The algorithm steps are as follows:

// First, we will select the range of the unsorted array using a loop (say i) that indicates the starting index of the range.
// The loop will run forward from 0 to n-1. The value i = 0 means the range is from 0 to n-1, and similarly, i = 1 means the range is from 1 to n-1, and so on.
// (Initially, the range will be the whole array starting from the first index.)
// Now, in each iteration, we will select the minimum element from the range of the unsorted array using an inner loop.
// After that, we will swap the minimum element with the first element of the selected range(in step 1). 
// Finally, after each iteration, we will find that the array is sorted up to the first index of the range. 

// Note: Here, after each iteration, the array becomes sorted up to the first index of the range. That is why the starting index of the range increases by 1 after each iteration. This increment is achieved by the outer loop and the starting index is represented by variable i in the following code. And the inner loop(i.e. j) helps to find the minimum element of the range [i…..n-1].

using namespace std;
void selection_sort(int arr[], int n) {
  // selection sort
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int mini = i;
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[mini]) {
        mini = j;
      }
    }
    int temp = arr[mini];
    arr[mini] = arr[i];
    arr[i] = temp;
  }

  cout << "After selection sort: " << "\n";
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";

}
int main() {
  int arr[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9};
  int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
   cout << "Before selection sort: " << "\n";
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << "\n";
  selection_sort(arr, n);
  return 0;
}

// Before selection sort:
// 13 46 24 52 20 9
// After selection sort:
// 9 13 20 24 46 52

// Time complexity: O(N2), (where N = size of the array), for the best, worst, and average cases.
